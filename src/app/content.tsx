			<p>
				Iâ€™m a mostly self-taught developer and designer with a passion for turning ideas into reality. My journey began in 2011 when I started building websites using HTML and CSS. Over the years, I expanded my skill set to include JavaScript, jQuery, React, and WordPress theme development.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hold an Associate of Science in Natural Science with a focus on Computer Science and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Creative Media. My academic journey exposed me to new concepts and methods in both design and development, enriching my approach to each project.
			</p>
			<p>
				As someone who is partially blind, I began my professional journey by helping local nonprofits that serve the blind community. This experience not only sharpened my skills but also deepened my commitment to creating accessible and impactful digital experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy guiding projects from ideation through deployment, always on the lookout for ways to automate and templatize portions of the work to make processes more efficient and scalable. This approach allows me to deliver high-quality results while continually refining my craft.
